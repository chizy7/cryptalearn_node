# CryptalearnNode

**CryptaLearn Node** is a distributed coordination backend built in Elixir that orchestrates privacy-preserving federated learning across multiple client nodes running the [CryptaLearn](https://github.com/chizy7/CryptaLearn) OCaml library. It serves as the central hub for secure model aggregation, privacy budget management, and federated training coordination.
